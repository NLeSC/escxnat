# 
# Version: @PROJECT_VERSION@
# Date: @PROJECT_DATE@
#

Requirements: 

- This toolkit needs Java 1.7 (jre or jdk).  
  This can be either the 32 of 64 bits version. 

To Start the GUI: 

- On windows, start either 'escxnat.exe' or 'escxnat.bat' 
  If the default esxcnat.exe fails to start the tool under the 64 bits version of Windows 64, 
  try the escxnat64.exe 
- Under Linux use the 'escxnat.sh' shell script. 
- For OSX you can use the escxnat.sh script as well if you have shell script support. 
  
If one of the above methods fails, you can also try the following command manually on your command line: 

    cd escxnat-@PROJECT_VERSION@ 
    java -jar esxcnat.jar
